# Implicit Semantic Data Augmentation for Deep Networks **(NeurIPS 2019)**

Code for the paper 'Implicit Semantic Data Augmentation for Deep Networks' (https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12220)

In this paper, we propose a novel implicit semantic data augmentation (ISDA) approach to complement traditional augmentation techniques like ï¬‚ipping, translation or rotation.
ISDA consistently improves the generalization performance of popular deep networks on supervised & semi-supervised image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection and instance segmentation.
